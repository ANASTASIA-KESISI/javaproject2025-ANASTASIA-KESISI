## About The Project

Welcome to the world of Monsters & Knights. Discover who will rule this land of utter imagination!

## Rules

You can freeroam around the map using the arrow keys. Press ESC at any time to pause the game.

Select the Stats button at any time to display the total number of Monsters/Knights and their total health. Check their current position, health and number of healings.
Select the Quit button to close the game.

There are 2 teams, Knights and Monsters.

Knights can move Up, Down, Left and Right, but Monsters are naughtier, they can move diagonical too.

If a fighter is next to each other, they can either heal each other(if allies) or fight(if enemies).
Healing can be random, and only if the Fighter that heals has healings and the health of the the one being healed is lower than the Max Health.
Attack can take place only if the attack stat of the attacking fighter is greater or equal to the attack stat of the defending fighter.

The game ends when one of the 2 teams has no fighers left on the map.
